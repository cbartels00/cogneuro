#Segmentations of the human basal ganglia
##Automated and manual segmentations
These segmentations of the basal ganglia were produced as part of a project at the Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, UCL. The segmentations for putamen (puta), caudate nucleus (caud), and nucleus accumbens (accu) were performed by the wonderful [FSL FIRST](http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FIRST). External and internal pallidum (GPe and GPi), substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area (SNVTA), and subthalamic nucleus (STN) were manually segmented by Peter Smittenaar using [ITK-SNAP ](http://www.itksnap.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php). 
None of these masks have been assessed for rater accuracy. For STN masks I would rather recommend [Birte Forstmann's maps](http://www.nitrc.org/projects/atag/) as they have been extensively validated.
##Source data
The segmentations were performed on multi-parameter maps (MPM) collected at 0.8mm isotropic at the Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, UCL. Read more about MPMs [on this UCL website](http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/Research/physics_info/QuantMRI_VBM.html). 
The results from this project are currently being prepared for publication.
##Use
Feel free to use the maps for whatever you like under the [WTFPL licence](http://www.wtfpl.net/).
